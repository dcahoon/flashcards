# flashcards
An app to make and manage decks of flash cards.

The app uses json server to save decks and cards to a local file.

The user can create and edit decks as well as cards.

Each card has a front and back side. The user can choose to study the deck. While studying the app will display the front of one card, allow the user to flip to see the back,
then allow the user to move to the next card. When the user views the back of the last card in the deck the page will prompt them to restart or return home.

Decks and cards are stored separately. All cards are stored in a single array and associated to their respective deck ids.

This project uses React.js and is styled with Bootstrap.
